## Installation

### Windows

1. Clone the repository or download the zip file and extract it.

2. Install [Python for Windows](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/).

4. Download [KoboldCPP.exe](https://github.com/LostRuins/koboldcpp/releases) and place it in the LlavaImageTagger folder.

5. Run `llmTester-run.bat` and wait for the model weights to download and Koboldcpp to start. 

The script will set up the Python environment, install dependencies, and download necessary model weights. This initial setup is performed only once and will take a few minutes depending on your download speed.

## Usage

1. Ensure KoboldCPP is running. Do not use the GUI windows until you see:
   ```
